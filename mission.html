<h2>Mission & Vision</h2>

<section>
  <h3>Mission</h3>
  <p>
    To advance scientific, cognitive, and national-security research for the public
    benefit by developing evidence-based tools, frameworks, and methodologies that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Strengthen democratic resilience and cognitive security.</li>
    <li>Support human recovery from trauma, especially severe PTSD.</li>
    <li>Make advanced sensing and AI systems safer, more transparent, and more accountable.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Vision</h3>
  <p>
    A world where advanced technology amplifies human safety, autonomy, and dignity
    instead of undermining it—where quantum tools, AI systems, and open-source
    intelligence are used to protect people and communities, not exploit them.
  </p>

  <h3>Founding context</h3>
  <p>
    ScubaRC is founded by a retired U.S. Navy Chief, rescue swimmer, and cyber threat
    intelligence lead who has spent decades operating at the intersection of
    national security, cryptologic operations, and hands-on rescue work.
